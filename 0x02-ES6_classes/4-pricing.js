Import the class Currency from 3-currency.js

Implement a class named Pricing:

Constructor attributes:
amount (Number)
currency (Currency)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullPrice that returns the attributes in the following-
format amount currency_name (currency_code).
Implement a static method named convertPrice.
It should accept two arguments: amount (Number), conversionRate (Number).
The function should return the amount multiplied by the conversion rate.
